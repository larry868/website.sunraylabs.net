**Bitcoin is born in 2008, Ethereum is born in 2013**, and their underlying technologies such as blockchain and smart-contracts, are disruptive innovations that make it possible to reinvent services and products that were unimaginable until then.

**The Blockchain, by definition decentralized, redefines the notion of trust in exchanges, and allows a fairer distribution of value between individuals.** It's at the heart of the major innovations that will have a strong societal impact in the 21st century.

**The Web3 market (sometimes called the crypto market) which is made up of solutions that integrate these technologies has been booming since 2016:** Layer1, Layer2 and sidechain, DeFI, NFT, Oracles, Identity, Web3 tooling, DApps, Walletsâ€¦. With hundreds of newcomers each week, the market is not slowing down and is reshuffling the cards of the historic web2.0 players.

**Larry aims to be a player in the Web3 revolution.**

Larry supports entrepreneurs in their Blockchain and Web3 strategy.
